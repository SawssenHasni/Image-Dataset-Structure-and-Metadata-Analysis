# Image Dataset Structure and Metadata Analysis
 This project aims to explore and analyze an image dataset organized into various categories such as paper, cans, and plastic. The analysis includes examining the folder structure, extracting image metadata (e.g., format, resolution, and dimensions), and handling multiple image formats like JPEG and PNG.  The project is designed to provide insights into dataset characteristics and streamline image processing tasks for machine learning and data analysis.
