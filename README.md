# Image Dataset Structure and Metadata Analysis  

This project aims to explore and analyze an image dataset organized into various categories such as **paper**, **cans**, and **plastic**. The analysis includes examining the folder structure, extracting image metadata (e.g., format, resolution, and dimensions), and handling multiple image formats like **JPEG** and **PNG**.  

The project is designed to provide insights into dataset characteristics and streamline image processing tasks for machine learning and data analysis.
